I want to attempt to recreate the machine learning used in this paper:

Menichetti, G., Ravandi, B., Mozaffarian, D. *et al.* Machine learning prediction of the degree of food processing. *Nat Commun* **14**, 2312 (2023). <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-37457-1>

I will either attempt to do it in Python or R and potentially use newer USDA guidelines for classifying ultra processed food than they did. 

I will work by myself.

Would you recommend trying to create this in Python or R? I have a good amount of R experience but a more thorough understanding of Python.
